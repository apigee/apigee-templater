Important Considerations This sample is a starting point and not legal advice.
Even a website that collects no data might have legal considerations depending
on its content, purpose, and the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates. Here's
why you should still be careful: Server Logs: Even if your code doesn't track
users, your hosting provider's web server almost certainly creates logs that
record IP addresses, time stamps, and pages requested. While you don't collect
this data from a user perspective, it is technically being recorded by a third
party on your behalf. You may want to investigate your host's policy on log
retention and mention it here or in a brief separate notice. External Services:
If you embed any external content (like a YouTube video, a Google Font, or a
third-party image), that third party will likely track the user. Your ToS should
clearly state that you are not responsible for the data collection practices of
those external services. (I covered this in Section 5). Copyright/Content: The
bulk of any "no-data" ToS will focus on intellectual property and acceptable
use, as those are still relevant even on a static site.
